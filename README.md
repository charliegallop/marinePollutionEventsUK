## TODO:

- [ ] Figure out thresholds for determining when there is a pollution event. This could be looking at bacteria or sewage determinands etc
- [X] May need to pivot the data. each determinand would need its own column. No idea how to do this yet
- [ ] Turn the processing of cleaning and pivotting the datasets into a function so I can then do it for all years
